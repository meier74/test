# /usr/local/bin/lpkGetFile.sh Ver. 1.1.2 23/9.2013 (jknudsen@cph.dk)
#
# Change: # 19/9-2013 (itajekn) 
# Added the user root's public key to the user sap's authorisation on the lpk
# server so fetching files or mounting the lpk fileshare as a SSHFS filesystem
# from lv-cphsapcpr can be done without requiring someone to physically type
# the password.

# Script designed to copy selected files related to the CPH parking business
# from the Windows server located in the Lufthavnsparkeringen DMZ to the
# lv-cphsapcpr SAP server. Must be run as the user root. Can be run on the
# command line as well as via root's crontab like this:
# /usr/local/bin/lpkGetFile.sh
#
# It is assumed that SAP reads the files every 15 minutes at 0,15,30,45
# the following is a possible root crontab entry:
#
# # Check for new lpk files. If new files are detected then copy the new
# # files from the LPK server to the SAP server. 
# 13,28,43,58 * * * * /usr/local/bin/lpkGetFile.sh

# Windows server located in the Lufthavnsparkeringen DMZ, (administered by
# the personnel working with the AirPortParking (Lufthavnsparkering) solution.
# Some details for INFO:
# SOURCE_HOST="10.153.143.67"
# SOURCE_ALLPAY="\ZMS-Share\AllPay"
# SOURCE_COUNTER="\ZMS-Share\Counter"
# The ZMS-Share is the '/' directory for the 'sap' SFTP user
# SOURCE_USER="sap"
# SOURCE_CRED="password can be found encrypted in the 'password database'"

# The source is being used for SFTP access by mounting a SSHFS filesystem on
# this # SAP server. The SSHFS filesystem is automatically mounted and
# unmounted every time this script needs access. Therefore the following
# (very long) line in /etc/fstab s required:
#
#  sshfs,noauto,users,exec,allow_other,reconnect,transform_symlinks,idmap=user 0 sshfs#sap@10.153.143.67:/ /home/lpk/lpk-sshfsmount  fuse    comment=sshfs,noauto,users,exec,allow_other,reconnect,transform_symlinks,idmap=user 0
#
# The mount procedure does not require someone to manually type aa password.
# The root@lv-cphsapcpr public key has been distributed to the 'sap' user on
# the source server.

# Where the source SFTP home directory is mounted on this the SAP server
 SOURCE_SSHFS="/home/lpk/lpk-sshfsmount"

# Mount the SSHFS filesystem (it is actually 'tweaking' a SFTP connection)
# and creating an abstraction layer that makes it appear to be an ordinary
# Unix/Linux filesystem
mount ${SOURCE_SSHFS}

# Check if the SSHFS filesystem is mounted, and exit if not.
# Also e-mail error to the fedtmule surveillance system.
if [ "`mount | grep lpk-sshfsmount`" = "" ] ; then
  echo "
  On `uname -n` the SSHFS filesystem mount failed, a single failure is OK
  because the missing lpk files will simply be copied during the next
  invocation of the script (which is run by cron 4 times per hour).

  You may test by issuing the command \'mount /home/lpk/lpk-sshfsmount\'
  as the user root on `uname -n`.
